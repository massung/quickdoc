# QuickDoc for LispWorks

The `quickdoc` package is a text markup implementation that is designed for brevity, simplicity, and unambiguity.

The parser and HTML renderer are for [LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com). There is also an output pane that can render QuickDoc strings.

## Quickstart

To see what QuickDoc looks like and the kind of HTML it outputs, see [a sample source](http://raw.github.com/massung/quickdoc/master/test.txt) and [the output HTML](http://github.com/massung/quickdoc/master/test.html).
